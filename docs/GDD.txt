LANGUAGE
python version 3
- pygame for graphics, pygame ui for gui, and libtcod for logic OR
- bearlib for everything
* I'll figure it out soon
all english in text/json for easy translations if needed


SCOPE
not very big rn just main mechanics etc
will probably implement the stuff in the d&d folder after the main mechanics
no/very basic animations if using bearlib

CORE MECHANIC
- food satiates player hunger that decreases every round depending on metabolism
- every monster drops an ingredient
- combining two different ingredients produces a unique meal
- eating ingredients reveals their effect but may only be done depending on INT
- unique meals produce unique effects
- undereating results in weight loss
- weight loss leads to weakness, starvation, and death 
- overeating results in weight gain
- weight gain leads to outgrowing armor pieces, slower movement, and cardiac arrest
- recipes change each playthrough
- eating gives exp to progress player levels
- on level up player can increase one of their attributes by 2

base attributes: 10 is average
vitality - hitpoints 0 hitpoints kills the character
metabolism - hunger rate 0 metabolism locks hunger rate
strength - attack damage 0 str = 0 damage
dexterity - armor; 0 dex locks movement
intelligence - how many memorized ingredients you may learn; 0 int gives control to AI

determined attributes: will be different depending on balancing etc...
current/max health - if u run out u die
current/max hunger - every round over max results in weight gain and every round under max 			     results in weight loss
armor - reduces incoming damage
min/max morbidly obese - going above reduces dex by 4 and kicks in heart disease
min/max obese - going above reduces dex by 3
min/max overweight - going above reduces dex by 2 
min/max normal weight - going below reduces str by 1 and going above reduces dex by 1
min/max underweight - going blow reduces str by 2
min/max severely underweight - going below reduce str by 3 and kicks in starvation

current exp/level - gained through eating; levelups available at exp threshholds
1 exp per meal
x = exp, y = level

hunger rate is stable
metabolism is like vitality for the hunger bar but doesn't scale with level
hunger is like health but going over is also dangerous


OR ditch eating rules and go monkey themed
classes:
gorilla     big and strong, need more food, can charge attack, (large bite and two large punches, large hd, +2 str +2 vit -2 met)
chimpanzee  start with extra bananas, nimble, can grapple attack, (bite, two claws, small hd, +2 dex), can climb back up stairs
orangutan   chill af, can use feet like hands (bite, 2 claws 2 punches, medium hd), can climb back up stairs
human       biggest peepee, pretends to be smart, excellent thrower, can cook food (very small bite and small two punches, small hd)
neanderthal great vision/FOV, excellent thrower, can rake attack,  can cook food (small bite and two punches, medium hd)

currency for shops is bananas but you can also eat them to fend off starvation, use them as a missile weapon, fuel a rage, make a trip trap, etc etc..

features to add:
console alerts when all monsters on level are dead
poop button
throw anything
yelling

REFINE:
rendering - new order: 1. floor, 2. stairs 3. items 4. monsters 5. player 6. walls if wall overlap 2-5 then make wall translucent
doors 
viewport
FOV shadows
console
working staircases
gear/items
inventory
map

TODO:
item quantities
monsters
traps
water
lava
money
shops
magic stuffs
grafting
(animations and sound/music can wait)

when game is somewhat done replace all sprites/animations with your own stuff

ANIMATIONS:
everything has a shaded variant (go in gimp and darken with a blue tint except for the background color (16, 16, 16))

creature animations: NORTH, NORTHEAST(northwest mirror), EAST(west mirror), SOUTHEAST(southwest morror), SOUTH for 5 unique sprite directions for each
walk, descend and ascend might be separate
attack, throw might be separate
dodge
take hit, die might be separate
pick up, drop might be separate
eat
poo
enter rage
yell

game mechanics: modular component system
