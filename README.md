Currently in pre-alpha as everything is still being implemented.
Uses tcod and pygame, pygame gui, as well as numpy.
Things implemented so far: procedural dungeon generation, isometric rendering with field of view, doors and staircases, test creatures with attributes, weapon varieties, combat system with feinting, blocking, throwing, etc. Currently there is not much to do as everything is still being added.
